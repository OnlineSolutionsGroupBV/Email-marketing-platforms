Email Marketing Platforms (HTTP2SMTP Services) 

**Email Marketing Platform** is a lightweight, open-source HTTP-to-SMTP email gateway, inspired by services like SendGrid or Mailgun, but designed to be simple, self-hosted, and easy to integrate.

It allows client applications to send transactional or marketing emails via a clean REST API (`POST /send-email/`), which then relays the messages through your own SMTP server. Built with Django (Python 2.7 compatible), this project is ideal for developers or small teams who need full control over their email infrastructure without relying on third-party providers.
