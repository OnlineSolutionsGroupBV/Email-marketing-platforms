# Email-marketing-platforms
Email Marketing Platforms (HTTP2SMTP Services) 

**Email Marketing Platform** is a lightweight, open-source HTTP-to-SMTP email gateway, inspired by services like SendGrid or Mailgun, but designed to be simple, self-hosted, and easy to integrate.

It allows client applications to send transactional or marketing emails via a clean REST API (`POST /send-email/`), which then relays the messages through your own SMTP server. Built with Django (Python 2.7 compatible), this project is ideal for developers or small teams who need full control over their email infrastructure without relying on third-party providers.

---

## üîß Features

- Send emails via a simple JSON POST request  
- One recipient per message (ideal for tracking delivery status)  
- Supports `text/plain` and `text/html` bodies  
- Adds `List-Unsubscribe` header automatically  
- Stores status (`queued`, `sent`, `bounced`, etc.) and full SMTP/bounce logs  
- IP whitelisting for secure access  
- Easy to deploy on any VPS with Apache2 and mod_wsgi  

---

## üéØ Use Cases

- Self-hosted transactional email delivery  
- API-driven email sending for SaaS products  
- Lightweight alternative to commercial SMTP APIs

## üìÑ Webmailer ‚Äì Self-Hosted HTTP-to-SMTP Email API

**Webmailer** is a lightweight, open-source Django-based HTTP-to-SMTP email microservice designed to offer a simple and flexible alternative to providers like SendGrid or Mailgun ‚Äî but fully hostable on your own infrastructure.

It exposes a clean, minimal HTTP API endpoint that accepts email parameters via `POST` and dispatches messages using your own SMTP server, with full logging and delivery status tracking.

This project is part of the broader `Email-marketing-platforms` initiative, where we aim to build a suite of open and self-hostable tools for sending and managing email campaigns and transactional messaging ‚Äî without vendor lock-in.

### üìÅ Structure

This is one of several tools being developed under `Email-marketing-platforms`. Future components may include:

* Bounce handler / webhook parser
* Template & contact manager
* Admin dashboard for delivery logs
* Cron-based campaign batch sender
* Mail merge and personalization tools

Each tool can be linked from this central repository, or optionally bundled together depending on integration needs.

---

### üì¶ Planned Extensions

* Token-based API auth
* Rate limiting per IP
* Multiple SMTP relay backends

---

## üì¶ Installation

1. Add the app to your Django project:

   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp maillogger
   ```

2. Add it to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

   python manage.py makemigrations maillogger
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

---

## üõ† Management Commands

### üîπ `parse_maillogs`

Parses mail logs (including `.gz` files) and stores delivery events in the `EmailLog` model.

```bash
python manage.py parse_maillogs
```

> ‚úÖ Supports automatic decoding and fallback for compressed logs.

---

### üîπ `classify_bounces`

Classifies previously parsed bounce records into `hard` or `soft` types based on the bounce reason.

```bash
python manage.py classify_bounces
```

> Recommended to run after `parse_maillogs` if you want to separate bounce classification logic.
